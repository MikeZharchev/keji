        information (such as IP address). If you permit the Services to access
        location services through the permission system used by your mobile

        receive precise location information from your device, which may
        compromise the accuracy of deliveries in some situations, for instance,
        if you are located in a park or another large area.
      </p>
      <p>2. Use of cookies and other tracking technologies</p>

      <p>3. Use of Your Personal Information</p>
      <p>
        We may use the information we collect or receive about you for various
        purposes.
      </p>
      <p>a. To provide you with the services</p>
      <p>
        We use your information to provide you the Services. For example, we use
        credit card information to complete a transaction or an address to allow
        the courier to fulfill your delivery. If the applicable information
        is to be provided or Service is to be performed by a third party, then
        we will disclose the applicable Personal Information to the third party
        providing the information or performing applicable Services. Your
        information may be available or provided to third-party service
        providers and that are contractually obligated to protect your
        information as disclosed in this Policy.
      </p>
      <p>b. To maintain, improve, and personalize the services</p>
      <p>
        We use your information for our everyday business operations such
        as auditing, administration of the Services, forum management,
        fulfillment, and analytics. Your information may also be used to improve
        the content and/or functionality of the Services. We may use your
        information to help us improve offerings for Keji and/or our Merchants.
        We also use your information to personalize your experience. For
        example, we may personalize the content and features you see when
        visiting our Services. In addition, we may personalize advertisements,
        marketing communications, and recommendations to make them more tailored
        to your interests.
      </p>
      <p>c. To communicate with you</p>
      <p>
        We use your information to communicate with you. For example, we may
        send you text messages or other notifications about the status of your
        orders and deliveries. We may also contact you with promotional
        offerings or other communications that may be of interest to you.
        If we send you marketing emails about services that may interest you,
        each email will contain instructions permitting you to ‘opt-out’
        of receiving future email marketing communications.<br />In the event
        you contact us, we use certain information to respond to your questions
        and assist you with any issues that may arise in your use of the
        Services. If you send text messages to a courier, using the telephone
        number for that courier available on the Services, we may use
        a third-party service provider to track and analyze these text messages.
        We track these text messages for fraud prevention, to ensure appropriate
        charging of fees, to enforce our Terms and Conditions, and for quality
        and training purposes. As part of this process, Keji and its service
        provider will receive in real time and store data about your text
        message, including the date and time of the text message, your phone
        number, and the content of the text message. You will not be able to opt
        out of transactional text messages between you and couriers.

        Keji has implemented administrative, technical, and physical security
        controls that are designed to safeguard Personal Information. However,
        no online activity is ever fully secure or error-free. While we strive

        through the Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination
        of letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser. If you

        have both a Caviar and Keji customer account, then the information
        associated with both accounts will be deleted to the extent we can
        identify that the accounts are owned by the same user. You may also
        designate an authorized agent to make a request to know or a request
        to delete. In order to be able to act, authorized agents have to submit
        written proof that they are authorized to act on your behalf, or have
        a power of attorney. We may deny requests from authorized agents who
        do not submit proof that they have been authorized by you to act
        on their behalf.
